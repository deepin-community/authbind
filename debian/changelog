authbind (2.1.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Cope with programs which set SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN.  (We assume
    they don't manipulate SIGCHLD on other threads, which is probably
    true.)  Patch from Marco d'Itri, slightly modified.  Closes:#765587.
  * Fix one-letter typo in previous changelog entry.
  * Add -n to gzip -9 rune, to help reproducibility.  Closes:#777727.
  * Fix FTCBFS: Use triplet-prefixed build tools.
    Patch from Helmut Grohne, modified.  Closes: #851206.

authbind (2.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Manpage has an example of which files will be checked and read
    Closes: #676540.
  * Do not include library version number in usage output from helper; the
    library and package version numbers are not the same, so this is
    misleading, and we do not want to introduce new machinery just to
    plumb the package version number through.  Closes: #676440.
  * Another minor wording fix in the manpage.

authbind (2.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  Bugfix:
  * 0-length ipv4 address masks (ie, 0.0.0.0/0) in byuid files wouldn't
    work because they would attempt a 32-bit shift.  This was reported
    against Ubuntu in Launchpad but the but is here too.  LP: #514278.

    Explain the problem more clearly in the manpage.  (Closes: 654706.)

    actually-implemented byte order convention.  (Closes: #651694.)

    actually link to libauthbind.

  * Change my email address.
  * Set Priority to optional as in ftpmaster override file.
